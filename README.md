Day 1 log snippet:
Researched open APIs to grab data from and how they come to handle latency delays etc, and also researched about MM and typical approaches to grasp the challenge.
Implemented BinanceBook (takes diff in depth reconstruction via U/u sequence checks) and OKXBook (books5 has 5level snapshots). Binance logic deletes levels when their quantity is 0 which is standard procedure discussed online, and sequence gaps trigger a resync and to reconstruct. OKX simply overwrites the top 5 each update . Freshness is handled via the t_arrive_ns timestamp which is stored per update. Going to finish up the OKX logic next, and then handle the fair-price engine.
